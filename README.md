In this project, we apply K-Means Clustering to segment retail customers based on their purchase history and demographic attributes, enabling the store to better understand customer behavior and tailor marketing strategies accordingly. K-Means is a widely used clustering technique, but several challenges must be managed to ensure accurate and meaningful results. These include determining the optimal number of clusters, which is crucial for capturing the nuances of customer groups without overfitting; scaling features like income and spending score to prevent biases in clustering; and handling categorical data, such as gender, which requires careful encoding to maintain interpretability.

Moreover, K-Means is sensitive to the initial placement of centroids, which can affect the quality of the clustering, and the algorithm may converge to suboptimal solutions. Additionally, customer behavior is dynamic, meaning the model may need to be updated regularly to remain relevant. Despite these challenges, K-Means Clustering, when properly applied, provides valuable insights into customer segments, allowing the retail store to develop more personalized marketing efforts, enhance customer engagement, and ultimately improve overall business perfor
